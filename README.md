# My SQL Journey - From Basics to LeetCode

Welcome to **my SQL Journey**! üöÄ This repository is where I document my progress in SQL, tackling problems from **basic queries** to **LeetCode-level challenges**. Along the way, I share **notes, explanations, and additional insights** to help others preparing for SQL **interviews**.

## üìå Why I Created This Repository

- **To track my progress** in mastering SQL from fundamentals to advanced concepts.
- **To help others** who are preparing for SQL interviews, data analysis, or database roles.
- **To build a structured learning path** with categorized solutions and interview tips.

## üìö SQL Topics I Cover

I cover key SQL topics in a structured way, explaining concepts as I learn and apply them.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Basics of SQL**

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Joins and Relationships**
- **INNER JOIN** - Extracting common records from both tables.
- **LEFT JOIN** - Keeping all records from the left table, even if unmatched.
- **RIGHT JOIN** - Keeping all records from the right table, even if unmatched.
- **FULL JOIN** - Combining all records from both tables.
- **SELF JOIN** - Joining a table with itself for hierarchical or related data.
- **CROSS JOIN** - Creating all possible row combinations.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Subqueries and Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**
- **Subqueries in SELECT, FROM, WHERE** - How to use nested queries for complex operations.
- **WITH CTEs** - Writing reusable, temporary query results for better readability.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Aggregation and Window Functions**
- **COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX** - Essential aggregation functions.
- **RANK(), DENSE_RANK(), ROW_NUMBER()** - Different ways to rank data.
- **LEAD(), LAG()** - Looking at previous or next rows in a dataset.
- **NTILE()** - Dividing rows into equal groups.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Advanced SQL Concepts**
- **UNION vs. UNION ALL** - Merging results efficiently.
- **CASE WHEN** - Applying conditional logic inside queries.
- **EXISTS vs. IN vs. NOT IN** - Filtering techniques and performance considerations.
- **COALESCE() and NULL Handling** - Dealing with missing values properly.
- **PIVOT and UNPIVOT** - Reshaping data for reporting purposes.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ **Indexes and Performance Optimization**
- **Indexes (Clustered & Non-clustered)** - Speeding up queries.
- **Query Execution Plans** - Understanding how queries are processed.
- **Normalization & Denormalization** - Structuring databases efficiently.
- **Stored Procedures & Triggers** - Automating tasks in SQL.

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ **SQL for Data Analysis**
- **Window Functions** - Implementing running totals, moving averages, etc.
- **Text Functions** - Manipulating strings (`CONCAT`, `SUBSTRING`, `LIKE`).
- **Date Functions** - Handling timestamps (`NOW()`, `DATEDIFF()`, `DATE_TRUNC`).
- **JSON & XML Handling** - Querying semi-structured data within SQL.

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ **SQL Interview Preparation**
- **Basic SQL Interview Questions**
- **Medium-Level SQL Challenges**
- **LeetCode Hard SQL Problems**
